Nearest Prime Number
====================

Find the nearest prime number to a given number X. If X is prime, print it. If there are two equally distant prime numbers, print the smaller one. For example, 43 and 47 are both nearest primes to 45; print 43.

You are expected to write a function to test if a number is prime and sequentially check all numbers near X, but alternate solutions will be accepted.

Example:
--------
Input:
> 45 

Output:
> 43
